<h1>World Bank School Survey Revamp</h1>

## Introduction 

The World Bank Global Program for Safer Schools is an initiative to improve school infrastructure safety at risk from natural hazards and disasters for children. Currently, 1.6 billion students attend schools across the world with about 6.6 million schools operating worldwide. However, due to earthquakes, an average of 2500 fatalities occur annually due to insufficient infrastructure  quality. The World Bank’s Global Program for Safer Schools plans investments and interventions for schools most impacted by natural disasters to improve safety for children. To accomplish this, the World Bank created a database, the Global Library for School Infrastructure, and uses data collection tools to develop plans for their Roadmap for Safer and Resilient Schools. Data collection is done by non-technical members of the community. It includes submitting photos of schools and answering questions about power supply, water access, environmental safeguards, and the learning environment. The current tool used for data collection is ArcGIS Survey123, a form and data collection tool. The World Bank has tasked us with simplifying and improving the questionnaire and to design an intuitive interface to guide users to input the desired information.


### Problem Statment

Non-technical users need an easy way to collect surveying data on school buildings and submit this data to the World Bank Global Program. We have observed that the ArcGIS Survey123 survey tool is challenging to use, hard to read and understand, and discouraging to use, which is causing inaccurate data to be submitted, and fewer forms to be received.

### User Interview Results

**Andrew Saxon**

Andrew Saxon is a 20 year old busboy and Math major at Cal Poly, SLO. Andrew is not a huge fan of filling out surveys but will do them when they are required or if a friend asks him to complete one. His biggest qualm with surveys is when they are too long or have a ton of pages to click through. He likes when forms have multiple choice questions and are all on one page.
Upon looking at the survey on the mobile app, Andrew was initially confused why it was in Spanish and could not figure out how to change the language. While completing the survey, he wanted some example photos to help him get good angles. He did really like the error feature that allowed him to click through the errors one by one.

**Emma Clarke**

Emma Clarke is a 20 year old RPTA major at Cal Poly, SLO. Emma likes taking surveys and finds them satisfying to complete. Her biggest issue when completing surveys in the past is when they are too long or the questions are worded poorly. She really likes when forms have multiple choice questions or give time estimates as to how long they will take to complete.
Upon looking at the survey on the mobile app, Emma did not like the font of the questions and found it confusing when a whole new question would pop up asking for a minimum of 3 photos. She also did not understand what the questions meant by “tier.” She also wanted to be able to review all of her answers before submitting without having to click back through each page. Overall, Emma thought the form was pretty good but would have liked a time estimate at the beginning to know how long the form would take. 

**Charles Huynh**

Charles Huynh is a 50 year old Software QA. He does not like filling out physical forms because they take too much time and effort. He prefers a step-by-step format when filling out forms since one long page is tiring and hard to go back to where he leaves off. He thinks that dropdown menus and progress bars (like Google Forms) are useful for selecting items and being aware of the status.
Upon looking at the survey on the mobile app, Charles did not like how small the text was on the screen. Throughout the survey he was frustrated with some terms. He was not sure what “Tier” levels or “Shifts” meant. He felt it was too difficult and inconvenient to obtain information from the principal/staff. Overall, he said the interface was easy to understand, but hard to read. He felt that the form was pretty difficult to fill out because it was tiring and hard to read.

**Isabelle Huynh**

Isabelle Huynh is a 23 year old Bioengineer. She does not like forms that require personal information or that take way too much time to complete (>10min). She prefers a step-by-step format (like Google Forms) when filling out forms. While filling out a form, she thinks that autofill and radio buttons are useful because they cut down on time.
Upon looking at the survey on the mobile app, Isabelle thought that it looked old-school and ugly. She explained that it looked hard to fill out because there were too many fill-in answers. Throughout the survey she was frustrated with some terms. She was not sure what “Tier” levels or “Shifts” meant. She felt it was too difficult and inconvenient to obtain information from the principal/staff. Overall, he said the interface was easy to understand, but hard to read. Since she thought that the form was not aesthetic, it was demotivating to fill out. In addition, the next button on the bottom right of the page did not work and confused her.

**Cimran Virdi**

Cimran Virdi is a 26 year old Engineering Lead. To begin the interview, the user was asked general questions about their experience with forms and surveys. From these questions, we learned that the user had a lot of complaints regarding previous form experience and made it clear that ill prepared forms cost her time and patience. From there, we moved into a walk through of the current version of the World Bank form. Throughout this experience, the user had difficulties understanding the stylistic components of the form, the questions that were being asked, and the form's structure. In particular, the user became frustrated with the design of dropdown and multi-select menus, finding them faulty and hard to understand and use. By the end of the walk through, the user was left dismayed by the time spent filling out the form and the overall unpleasant experience.

**Mariclare Newsom**

Mariclare Newsom is a 21 year old nursing student. The experience of the second user was not unlike the first. This user also expressed disinterest in filling out ill-designed and long forms. When walking through the current WB form, the user experienced many of the same confusions as the first with regards to the design and functionality of components on the form. Particularly, this user felt that it was unnecessary and unintuitive for sections of the form to be open and closed in order to reveal the questions. Additionally, they felt that many of the questions on the form would be easier to understand if diagrams, definitions, and links to more information were included. Overall, this user had a similarly unpleasant experience and was left feeling somewhat defeated.

**Adrian Kim**

Adrian Kim is 21 years old and a college student. He does not like forms that are overwhelmingly heavy in text. When Adrian was asked about other times he had given up filling out forms and why he stopped, he stated it was usually when the survey had an error but would not point him to where the error was.

Adrian was given the current form in-use by the World Bank and attempted to complete it, and was then asked follow-up questions. He was unsuccessful in completing the form and gave up while filling it out. Adrian stated that they were initially unphased by the form since it looked short despite being visually unappealing. He stated the questions were not difficult to understand, but that the questions were formatted poorly and the method of supplying an answer to some questions felt inconvenient and repetitive. For example, instead of having to select “yes” or “no” multiple times, a check box with questions lined up in a table would be easier to use. In addition, the candidate had difficulty using the survey because the arrows at the bottom seemed to indicate the current page the user was on but did not function in any way. 

**Krishna Nathani**

Krishna Nathani is 18 years old and a senior in high school. She does not like long forms that require a lot of text input and prefers having pre-selected options. When asked if she has ever given up on filling out a form and why she gave up, she says if a form feels too long but does not have a progress bar, she will stop. 

Krishna was able to complete the survey but described it as unpleasant and challenging to use. She also felt negative about the interface and aesthetics of the survey. She disliked that font sizes did not differentiate questions and question descriptions. Krishna also disliked the background image and called it “distracting.” She also stated it would be easier if the surveys collapse feature was instead a “jump-to section” feature instead allowing for easier navigation.
