World Bank School Survey 
========================

## INTRODUCTION 

The World Bank Global Program for Safer Schools is an initiative to improve school infrastructure safety at risk from natural hazards and disasters for children. Currently, 1.6 billion students attend schools across the world with about 6.6 million schools operating worldwide. However, due to earthquakes, an average of 2500 fatalities occur annually due to insufficient infrastructure  quality. The World Bankâ€™s Global Program for Safer Schools plans investments and interventions for schools most impacted by natural disasters to improve safety for children. To accomplish this, the World Bank created a database, the Global Library for School Infrastructure, and uses data collection tools to develop plans for their Roadmap for Safer and Resilient Schools. Data collection is done by non-technical members of the community. It includes submitting photos of schools and answering questions about power supply, water access, environmental safeguards, and the learning environment. The current tool used for data collection is ArcGIS Survey123, a form and data collection tool. The World Bank has tasked us with simplifying and improving the questionnaire and to design an intuitive interface to guide users to input the desired information.


### Problem Statment

Non-technical users need an easy way to collect surveying data on school buildings and submit this data to the World Bank Global Program. We have observed that the ArcGIS Survey123 survey tool is challenging to use, hard to read and understand, and discouraging to use, which is causing inaccurate data to be submitted, and fewer forms to be received.
